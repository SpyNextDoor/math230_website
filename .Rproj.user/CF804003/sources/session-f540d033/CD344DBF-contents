title: "Impacts of Student Habits on Performance"
description: |
  In this section, I talk about how various habits like exercising, or phone use impact the perfomance of students.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
library(gghalves)
library(ggalt)
library(dplyr)
library(ggmosaic)
```


```{r,echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
rasta.palette <- c("#096d41", "#fbb927", "#0099ff", "#df212b", "#ffccff", "#ccccff", "#9966cc", "#99ccff")
```


Student's success is not only determined by how rigorous the programs are. They are external factors that may contribute positively or negatively. In this investigation, I try to make connections to these external factors that I believe impact student success. 

I will use a random sample of 300 observation since the data set is huge.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
set.seed(231)
sample.ids <- sample(1:1000, 300)

sample.std <- std.habits[sample.ids, ]
attach(sample.std)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# SAMPLE 
sample.std$attendance_cat <- cut(
  sample.std$attendance_percentage,
  breaks = c(-Inf, 60, 80, 100),
  labels = c("Low", "Medium", "High"),
  right = TRUE
)

```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# FULL DATASET
std.habits$attendance_cat <- cut(
  std.habits$attendance_percentage,
  breaks = c(-Inf, 75, 90, 100),
  labels = c("Low", "Medium", "High"),
  right = TRUE
)
```

### Attendance

If students do not attend class, there is a chance that some content will be hard for them to grasp. To look into attendance we have to also look into things that may affect it. An example is Netflix hours.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Your original ggplot
p <- ggplot(sample.std, aes(x = netflix_hours, y = attendance_percentage)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.9, color = "#0099ff", size = 1) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE, color = "darkred") +
  labs(title = "Scatter Plot: Netflix Hours vs Attendance",
       x = "Netflix Hours",
       y = "Attendance (%)") +
  theme_minimal()

# Make it interactive
ggplotly(p)

```


In this scatter plot, we can see that although the attendance level is varied across the y-axis, as the number of hours spent on Netflix increase, the number of students decrease. Which mean that Netflix can affect attendance. 


```{r,include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# HISTOGRAM of ATTENDANCE

ggplot(std.habits, aes(x = attendance_percentage)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2.5, bins = 20, fill = "steelblue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Histogram of Attendance Percentage",
       x = "Attendance Percentage",
       y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()

```


```{r, include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# HISTOGRAM of MENTAL HEALTH 

ggplot(std.habits, aes(x = mental_health_rating)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "steelblue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Histogram of Mental Health",
       x = "Mental Health",
       y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
# bin exam scores

sample.std <- sample.std %>%
  mutate(
    exam_cat = case_when(
      exam_score < 50 ~ "Fail",
      exam_score < 75 ~ "Pass",
      TRUE ~ "Excellent"
    ),
    exam_cat = factor(exam_cat, levels = c("Fail", "Pass", "Excellent"))
  )
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# SAMPLE MENTAL HEALTH
sample.std <- sample.std %>%
  mutate(
    mental_heath_cat = case_when(
      sample.std$mental_health_rating < 3.3 ~ "Worst",
      sample.std$mental_health_rating < 7 ~ "Bad",
      TRUE ~ "Best"
    ),
    mental_heath_cat = factor(mental_heath_cat, levels = c("Worst", "Bad", "Best"))
  )
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# FULL DATASET
std.habits <- std.habits %>%
  mutate(
    exam_cat = case_when(
      exam_score < 50 ~ "Fail",
      exam_score < 75 ~ "Pass",
      TRUE ~ "Excellent"
    ),
    exam_cat = factor(exam_cat, levels = c("Fail", "Pass", "Excellent"))
  )
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}

ggplot(data = sample.std) +
  geom_mosaic(aes(x = product(attendance_cat, mental_heath_cat), fill = attendance_cat)) +
  labs(title = "Mosaic Plot: Attendance vs Mental Health",
       x = "Mental Heath",
       y = "Attendance",
       fill = "Attendance Category") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = rasta.palette[c(3, 6, 5)]) +
  theme_minimal()

```

By observing the width of the bins above in the mosaic graph, with `worst` and `bad` mental health we see some low attendance. This emphasizes my assumptions at the beginning. It is worth noting that sometimes students choose not to report their mental health status at the extremities which might be why we have a higher number in the middle. 

### Mental Health

Mental health is also a big thing in our daily lives. Students can't do well in school when they are unwell mentally. I believe that exercise rate can impact the mental well being of students. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(sample.std, aes(x = mental_heath_cat, y = exam_score)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = rasta.palette[c(5)]) +
  labs(title = "Exam Score by Mental Health across Exercise Frequency",
       x = "Mental Health (Binned)",
       y = "Exam Score") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = rasta.palette[c(4)]) +
  theme_minimal()

```

From the above box plot, we can identify an upward trend. The median of the right most boxplot is higher than those of the two before it. This is a good indication that the better the mental health, the more likely students are to get good scores in exams. 


### Studying Hours

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(sample.std, aes(x = study_hours_per_day, y = exam_score)) +
  geom_bin2d(bins = 30) +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = rasta.palette[c(6)], high = rasta.palette[c(7)]) +
  labs(title = "Heat Map of Exam Scores vs. Study Hours",
       x = "Study Hours",
       y = "Exam Score") +
  theme_minimal()
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(sample.std, aes(x = study_hours_per_day, y = exam_score)) +
  geom_density_2d_filled() +
  labs(title = "2D Density Heat Map: Study Hours vs. Exam Score",
       x = "Study Hours",
       y = "Exam Score") +
  theme_minimal()

```
