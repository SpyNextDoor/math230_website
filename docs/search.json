In this investigation, I try to make connections to these external factors that I believe impact student success.\nI will use a random sample of 300 observation since the data set is huge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttendance\nIf students do not attend class, there is a chance that some content will be hard for them to grasp. To look into attendance we have to also look into things that may affect it. An example is Netflix hours.\n\n\n\nIn this scatter plot, we can see that although the attendance level is varied across the y-axis, as the number of hours spent on Netflix increase, the number of students decrease. Which mean that Netflix can affect attendance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy observing the width of the bins above in the mosaic graph, with worst and bad mental health we see some low attendance. This emphasizes my assumptions at the beginning. It is worth noting that sometimes students choose not to report their mental health status at the extremities which might be why we have a higher number in the middle.\nMental Health\nMental health is also a big thing in our daily lives. Students can’t do well in school when they are unwell mentally. I believe that exercise rate can impact the mental well being of students.\n\n\n\nFrom the above box plot, we can identify an upward trend. The median of the right most boxplot is higher than those of the two before it. This is a good indication that the better the mental health, the more likely students are to get good scores in exams.\nStudying Hours\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

This was fascinating to me because I did not know R could do something like that. From left to right, the artwork is (1) Rastafari (2) BU Artwork and (3) Swirls.\n\n\n\nGGPLOT VISUALIZATIONS\nA big part of this course was to analyze data and make meaningful visualizations to tell the stories from the data. In this part I will walk you through an example\nof the visualizations we did.\n\n\n\nDoes the growth of Sepal length affect the Petal length?\nIn this example, I was working with the iris dataset which gives the mesurements in centimeters of variables of 3 species of iris. Those are sepal length and width, and petal length and width. Particularly, in this visualization, I was investigating if the sepal length has any impact on the petal length. And from the observation, we can see that as the sepal length increases so does the petal length.\n\n\n\nHowever, there is an exception seen in the setosa species which indicates that the sepal growth is not as impactful as in other species. This is what the facets help us to visualize.\nINTRO STATS DASHBOARD\nTo demonstrate our understanding of the introductory statistics concepts, we were asked to make a dashboard for students taking intro stats to help solidify the concepts accompanied by visualizations. My group worked on helping students understand better the concept of sampling distribution. This is a concept that I myself struggled with at first. Understanding that the distribution comes from a statistic computed from many samples of the same size.\n\n\nMORE VISUALIZATIONS\nIn this section, I will show 2 distributions from concepts that were new to me or intersting.\n1. BOOTSTRAPING DISTRIBUTION\nBootstrapping is a resampling method that allows us to estimate the sampling distribution of a statistic when we don not have enough information or do not want to assume anything about the population distribution.\nTo me this was fascinating. I did not know that it is possible to infer a statistic with only one good sample representation of the population.\n\n\n\nHere, we have a gamma distribution as our pupulation distribution. To build a bootstrap distribution, we need to resample with replacement to get different samples.\nWe take 10000 samples of the same size to build a bootstrap distribution.\n\n\n\n2. GG-HALVES\nThe gg-halves plot is one that fascinated me throughout the semester. A gg-halves plot is a plot that has two sides each with a different shape. This is done to tell a story in two different perspectives. In the following visualization, I used mtcars dataset and used horsepower, cylinders and transmission.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, we can see each violin plot for both automatic and manual being shown above, and it makes for an easy comparision between the two. Fairly quickly, we can see how cars with 8 cylinders vary a lot in horsepower with whether they’re automatic or a manual.\n\n\n\n",
